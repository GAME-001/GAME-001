# GAME-001
This is a repository prepared for future work on GAME-001. 

This game is based on ideology that we are not alone in the universe and is expected to follow [VOYAGER-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1)'s destiny with different message for aliens in a form of Open-Source game hopefully influencing the space to focus on science instead of violence.

Game is made to describe our (and other known species in our solar-system) known history as close as possible from all possible points of views.

Game is expected to be 100% open-source with merges to support everything.
